This repo will be my experiments with audio data processing and Deep Learning for speech recognition. 


## Data 

I will be using some of the well known datasets used in audio machine learning as well as a few lesser known sets. 
The following datasets will be used:
- [TensorFlow Speech Recognition Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/tensorflow-speech-recognition-challenge/data)
- [VOiCES](https://iqtlabs.github.io/voices/)
- [LibriSpeech 960h](http://www.openslr.org/12/)
- [Switchboard 300h](https://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC97S62)
- [Mozilla's Common Voice Dataset](https://commonvoice.mozilla.org/en/datasets)
- [Speech Accent Archive](https://www.kaggle.com/rtatman/speech-accent-archive)
- [Audio, Speech, and Vision Processing Lab Emotional  Sound database (ASVP-ESD)](https://www.kaggle.com/dejolilandry/asvpesdspeech-nonspeech-emotional-utterances)
